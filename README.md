*Project Overview*  
This project aims to automate job applications on LinkedIn for positions with the "Easy Apply" option. Additionally, it integrates with Copilot to intelligently answer the application questions based on provided input data.

*Requirements*  
To run this project, the following data is needed:  
- *Email Address*  
- *Password*  
- *CV*  

*Setup Instructions*  
1. Provide your email address and password.  
2. Open your CV document, copy its contents, and paste them into an empty text file.  
3. Append the following text at the end of the file:  
     
   My current salary = [xxxx]  
   My expected salary = [xxxxx]  
   This is my CV, and I want to answer questions related to this CV.  

   - For "Yes" or "No" questions, the answer should be limited to "Yes" or "No" only.  
   - For questions requiring a numerical response (e.g., "How many years of experience do you have in Java?"), the answer should contain only the number (e.g., "2").  
   - I do not require visa sponsorship now or in the future.  

   Mobile phone number: [01xxxxxxxxx]  
   Country code: Egypt (+20)  
     

*Key Considerations*  
Ensure the information provided is accurate and follows the outlined format for seamless integration and optimal performance during the automation process.
